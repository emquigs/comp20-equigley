README.txt - Assignment 5
Security Assessment of Dan Pasternak's 2048 Gamecenter

1. Due to time constraints, I was only able to complete write-ups for 2 of the hacks I performed on Dan's gamecenter. Other than that, the analysis page itself has been implemented correctly.

2. I initially discussed the project with Dan Pasternak ('15), because we had to trade source code and figure out how each of us implemented the Assignment 4 specifications. I also briefly discussed it with Sahil Kathawala ('15) to generate ideas of how to hack the API.

3. This project took about 4.5 hours to complete.
