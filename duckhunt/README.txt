README.txt - Assignment 2 - Duckhunt
Emily Quigley

1. This assignment is the initial setup for a JavaScipt version of the classic game "Duckhunt", utilizing a game.js file that draws to a canvas in the index.html file. All images are part of the sprite sheet "duckhunt.png". The sky, dirt, road, bushes, tree, dog, and 5 birds have all been drawn to the canvas and are implemented correctly. If the browser is incompatible with JavaScript canvas, the page displays a "Sorry" message instead of rendering the game.
2. I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment, and I used both Mozilla Developer Network and W3Schools as references when working on how to splice parts of the sprite sheet into the canvas area.
3. This project took approximately 4.5 hours to complete.
