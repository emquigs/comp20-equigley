README.txt - Lab 4 - OMFGDOGS!

1. This lab utilizes the index.html file which implements the omfgdogs.css stylesheet. Implementation of background went smoothly. I had a few unsuccessful attempts at implementing the credit message, but realized it was nested inside a div that was covering the text. Instead of pointing to two different stylesheets depending on screen size, my stylesheet has visibilty rules for things that need to be changed depending on screen size (ie. warning message and credit link).
2. I did not collaborate with any other students on this lab. I used Mozilla Developer Network as a reference for media query syntax.
3. This lab took about 1.5 hours total to complete.
