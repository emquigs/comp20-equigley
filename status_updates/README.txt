README.txt - Lab 5 - Status Updates

1. profile.html demonstrates the use of Javascript code inside an HTML page by updating statuses typed in by the page's visitor. All of the parts of this lab have been implemented correctly, and the Javascript function is called by the "onchange" attribute for the input box. The box also clears once a status has been entered so that the viewer knows their status has been updated.
2. For this lab, I worked on debugging my "onchange" attribute and date objects with help from Matthew Long and consulted Mozilla Developer Networks and W3 Schools for DOM methods.
3. This lab took me a total of about 2.5 hours.
