README.txt - Assignment #3
Emily Quigley

1. As of now, everything has been implemented correctly. Earlier in working on this assignment I had it so that the 
   t line/stations that appeared on the map were the ones that corresponded to the station closest to you, which I think makes more sense than having the random t line from the MBTA rodeo API load, but I changed it to fit the assignment instructions. Also, instead of having an error message appear when the MBTA API server returns a status code of 500, the request is automatically made again.
2. Thanks to Kenneth Cohen ('14) for helping me organize my logic behind creating the polylines. Other than 
   referencing stack overflow and MDN, I did not have any other collaboration on this assignment.
3. I spent about 12 hours completing this assignment.
