README.txt - Assignment #3
Emily Quigley

1. As of now, everything has been implemented correctly except for the train schedule in the station pop-up windows.   Earlier in working on this assignment I had it so that the t line/stations that appeared on the map were the ones
   that corresponded to the station closest to you, which I think makes more sense than having the random t line
   from the MBTA rodeo API load, but I changed it to fit the assignment instructions.
2. Thanks to Kenneth Cohen for helping me organize the logic behind creating the polylines. Other than referencing
   stack overflow and MDN, I did not have any other collaboration on this assignment.
3. I spent about 9 hours completing this assignment.
