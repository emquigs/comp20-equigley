README.txt - Lab 6

1. This lab utilizes the jobs.html file which references the jobs.css stylesheet. It uses JSON to parse a string into JavaScript objects, and displays only the company, location, & position of each "friend of Ming's". Implementation of all JS, CSS, HTML, and JSON items is correct and there are no errors in the JavaScript console when the page renders.
2. I did not collaborate with any other students on this lab, but I consulted both Mozille Developer Network and W3Schools for certain JSON parsing questions.
3. The lab took me approximately 3 hours to finish.
