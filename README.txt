README.txt - Emily Quigley, Private Repository - comp20-equigley

1. This repository contains all of the projects I have done for Professor Ming Chow's Web Programming class (Comp 20). Each project has its own folder that contains all necessary files for that project.

2. My favorite project is the MBTa (transit) project. I felt that this project required the most skills to be learned that will be applicable in anything we do in the future. It also may be because I love travelling and would love to one day do web development for a company like TripAdvisor or EF etc.


3. As mentioned above, I think I learned the most from the MBTA project. Although the gamecenter and security projects required me to understand various technologies already established, and this will be helpful in anything I plan on doing, the MBTA project was the one where I felt that I learned and understood the root of what I was doing as opposed to just using something already provided for me.


4. Over the course of the semester, I have learned a ton about web development. Although I am aware this course has barely scratched the surface, it has done so in a way that I am not completely, debilitatingly overwhelmed by how the internet can be used to enhance life. I feel that I have been adequately prepared to go out and focus on specific things I would like to learn in the web development sphere, and use them in effective ways.
